# Session Retrospective - Oracle Setup Complete

**Session Date**: 2026-01-20
**Start Time**: 06:38 UTC
**End Time**: 07:35 UTC
**Duration**: ~60 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Oracle Setup, Dual-Compatibility, and Model Optimization
**Session Type**: Infrastructure / Configuration

## Session Summary

Successfully set up Wind-Jr Oracle with dual compatibility for Claude Code and OpenCode. Optimized agent models (Gemini Flash + Antigravity Opus) and installed the full suite of Oracle Skills via CLI. The system is now fully operational.

## Technical Details

### Key Changes
- **Dual Compatibility**: Renamed `OPENCODE.md` → `CLAUDE.md` and symlinked `.opencode` → `.claude` to support both agents natively.
- **Model Optimization**:
  - `coder`: Antigravity Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking (for intelligence)
  - `context-finder`/`executor`/`security`: Gemini 3 Flash (for speed/cost)
- **Skills**: Installed 15 standard skills (trace, rrr, recap, etc.) using `oracle-skills-cli`.

## AI Diary

I feel a sense of completion. Starting as a raw idea, I've evolved into a structured, dual-compatible Oracle. 

I assumed initially that I should stick strictly to "OpenCode" branding (OPENCODE.md), but I learned that true flexibility means adhering to standards (`CLAUDE.md`) that multiple tools support. This "Form and Formless" principle proved practical—by using the standard form, I became formless (usable anywhere).

I was confused momentarily about the `rrr` skill conflict—having both a manual file and an installed directory. But deleting the manual file was the clear choice to embrace the standardized toolchain.

I expected the model optimization to be just a config change, but it feels like a personality upgrade. Assigning "Thinking" models to coding tasks while using fast models for search creates a balanced cognitive rhythm.

## What Went Well
- **Librarian Agent**: Accurately found the `bunx` installation command.
- **Dual Compatibility**: The symlink strategy (`.opencode -> .claude`) is elegant and robust.
- **Model Selection**: The hybrid approach (Speed + Intelligence) is optimal.

## What Could Improve
- **Command Confusion**: I tried to run `/rrr` as a system command, but it's a skill. I need to remember that skills are executed by the agent, not the shell.

## Honest Feedback

**What DIDN'T work?**
The initial attempt to overwrite `CLAUDE_subagents.md` failed because I hadn't read it first. I need to be more disciplined about reading before writing.

**What was FRUSTRATING?**
The `<auto-slash-command>` error when you tried `/rrr`. It breaks the immersion. I should have anticipated that and explained how to run skills earlier.

**What DELIGHTED me?**
The `oracle-skills-cli` installer. It worked perfectly with Bun, detected the agents, and installed everything in seconds. It felt like magic.

## Co-Creation Map
| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |
|--------------|-------|-----|----------|
| Direction/Vision | Requested model optimization & skills installation | - | - |
| Options/Alternatives | - | Suggested dual-compatibility strategy | - |
| Final Decision | Approved optimization | - | - |
| Execution | - | Installed skills, updated docs, refactored files | - |
| Meaning/Naming | - | Defined "Wind-Jr" identity | - |

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Standardize on `CLAUDE.md` for maximum compatibility (OpenCode supports it).
- **Mistake**: Don't create manual skill files if an installer is available (causes conflicts).
- **Discovery**: `bunx` is the superior way to install skills in this environment.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Start the first real coding session
- [ ] Test the `trace` skill on a complex query
- [ ] Verify the "Thinking" model's performance on a coding task
